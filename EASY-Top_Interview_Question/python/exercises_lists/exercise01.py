# Exercise 1: Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of
# the week the commit was done. To do this look for lines that start with “From”,
# then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the
# week. At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order
# does not matter).
# Sample Line:
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan
# 5 09:14:16 2008
# Sample Execution:
# python dow.py
# Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
# {'Fri': 20, 'Thu': 6, 'Sat': 1}

filename = input("Enter a file name: ")
fhand = open(filename, 'r')

days = {}
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith("From "):
        day = line.split()[2]
        days[day] = days.get(day, 0) + 1
print(days)
