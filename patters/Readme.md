- Using  a length of  256 integer array to represent the character counts
- Hash Table, map character to count of the number of occurrences of that, then compare both strings
-  Using two pointer in a string, example: reversed string

* Using length 256 array
* Using two pointers
* Doing string math
* String comparison
* Strign algorithms
